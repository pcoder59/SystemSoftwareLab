Step 1: Start
Step 2: Open Input File in Read Mode
Step 3: Open optab File in Read Mode
Step 4: Open Output File In Write Mode
Step 5: Open Symtab File in Write Mode
Step 6: Read label, opcode and operand from Input File
Step 7: If opcode != "START" go to Step 11
Step 8: Save operand as starting address
Step 9: Initialize locctr as operand
Step 10: Read next label, opcode and operand from Input File. Then go to Step 12
Step 11: Initialize locctr as 0
Step 12: If opcode == "END" go to Step 25
Step 13: If label != "**" go to Step 18
Step 14: Read opcode from optab
Step 15: Write locctr, label, opcode and operand to output file
Step 16: Increment locctr by 3
Step 17: Read Next label, opcode, operand and go to Step 12
Step 18: Save label, locctr to symtab
Step 19: Write locctr, label, opcode and operand to output file
Step 20: If opcode == "WORD", increment locctr by 3
Step 21: If opcode == "RESW", increment locctr by 3 * operand
Step 22: If opcode == "BYTE", increment locctr by 1
Step 23: If opcode == "RESB", increment locctr by operand
Step 24: Read next label, opcode, operand and go to Step 12
Step 25: Write locctr, ** END, starting address to output file
Step 26: Stop
